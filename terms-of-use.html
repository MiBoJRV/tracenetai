            CS, constitute the entire agreement between the user and CS regarding the use of CS's services,

            including but not limited to purchase orders, acknowledgments, or other similar documents, shall have no
            force or effect unless specifically agreed to in writing by CS.</p>
        <p>In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between these Terms and Conditions and any other agreement or
            policy provided by CS, these Terms and Conditions shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise by CS in
